# Proof of Assets

The Proof of Assets protocol consists of two the proof of reserves protocol and proof of non-collusion.
The Proof of Reservers

- A circuit that proves that P_assets is subset of P where P are the total addresses
- Create a commitment C_assets_i for each asset i to the total amounts of P_known addresses. Also create a proof that only the known assets balances are included
- Create a proof of non-collusion by showing that a list L2 is permutation of list L1.
